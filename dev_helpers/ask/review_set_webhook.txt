Review scripts/set_webhook.py

Please verify that this script:
1. Exits with non-zero status code on failure
2. Has proper `if __name__ == "__main__": main()` structure
3. Has appropriate error handling and logging
4. Returns proper exit codes for success/failure scenarios

Context: This script is used in CI/CD pipeline and needs to fail builds if webhook setup fails.
