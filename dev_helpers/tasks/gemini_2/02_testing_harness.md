# Task: Implement Automated Testing Harness

## Description
Create an automated testing framework using pytest that validates the core functionality without requiring Docker setup or webhook registration:
- Add test fixtures to mock Telegram, OpenAI, and Firestore
- Test health endpoint
- Test webhook flow with simulated Telegram update
- Allow for simple validation via pytest command

## Owned Files
- requirements.txt
- tests/__init__.py
- tests/conftest.py
- tests/test_health.py
- tests/test_webhook_flow.py
- bot/__init__.py

## Status
done

## Implementation Notes
- Added pytest and test dependencies to requirements.txt
- Created test fixtures to mock Telegram, OpenAI and Firestore
- Implemented health endpoint test that validates API response
- Implemented webhook flow test that ensures request handling works
- Added a test for message processing to verify message storage
- Created a testing mode that does not require real credentials
- Improved FastAPI app to use proper lifespan management

## Review Notes
- All tests pass successfully
- The testing harness allows validation without Docker or webhook setup
- Implementation follows pytest best practices with fixtures and mocks
- The test setup allows non-technical users to verify functionality with a simple command
