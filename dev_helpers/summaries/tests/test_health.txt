This `pytest` file contains a test function `test_health_endpoint`. Its main purpose is to verify the functionality of a web application's health check endpoint, typically located at `/health`. The test sends a GET request to this endpoint and asserts that the response has a 200 OK status code and that the JSON body contains a `"status"` field with the value `"ok"`. This ensures the basic health and responsiveness of the application.
