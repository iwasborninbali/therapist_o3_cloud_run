This Python file contains pytest tests designed to verify the functionality of a Docker container running a telegram bot application. It uses pytest fixtures to manage the lifecycle of the Docker environment, including building a test image and starting/stopping a container. The tests then make HTTP requests to the running container's `/health` and `/webhook` endpoints to check their responses and status codes. The tests can be skipped via the `SKIP_CONTAINER_TESTS` environment variable.
