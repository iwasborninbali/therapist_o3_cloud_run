This Python file contains pytest tests for a web application handling Telegram webhooks. It includes tests to ensure the `/webhook` endpoint responds immediately with a 200 OK status upon receiving a Telegram update. The file also tests the internal message processing flow, using mocking (`monkeypatch`) to verify that incoming messages are correctly handled and processed, such as being added to a simulated storage. It uses a mock `TELEGRAM_UPDATE` payload for testing. The tests check for fast response times and proper function calls within the processing logic.
