This file serves as the main entry point for a FastAPI application designed to handle a Telegram bot's webhook. It initializes and manages a `telegram.ext.Application` instance using a lifespan context manager. The application exposes a `/webhook` endpoint to receive and process updates from Telegram. It also includes basic root (`/`) and health check (`/health`) endpoints. Error handling middleware is added to the FastAPI app.
