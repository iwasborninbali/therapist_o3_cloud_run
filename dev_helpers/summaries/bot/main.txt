This `main.py` file serves as the entry point for a FastAPI web application hosting a Telegram bot. It initializes the Telegram bot application (`initialize_bot`) upon startup and shuts it down on exit using a lifespan manager. The application exposes a `/webhook` endpoint to receive and process Telegram updates using the initialized bot. It also provides basic `/` and `/health` endpoints and includes error handling middleware. The script runs the FastAPI app via uvicorn when executed directly.
