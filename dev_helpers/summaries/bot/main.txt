This file is the main entry point for a FastAPI web application serving as a backend for a Telegram bot. It initializes the Telegram bot application on startup and manages its shutdown. The application exposes endpoints for health checks, a root path, and a `/webhook` endpoint to receive and process Telegram updates asynchronously using background tasks. It also includes an administrative endpoint (`/admin/send-proactive`) to trigger sending proactive messages based on timezone and time slot. The script uses uvicorn to run the FastAPI application.
