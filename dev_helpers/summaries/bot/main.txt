This file is the main entry point for a FastAPI application that hosts a Telegram bot. It initializes the Telegram bot application (`telegram.ext.Application`) on startup and manages its lifecycle using a lifespan context manager. The application defines a `/webhook` endpoint to receive and process incoming Telegram updates. It also includes endpoints for health checks (`/health`), a root status page (`/`), and an administrative endpoint (`/admin/send-proactive`) to trigger sending proactive messages. The script uses uvicorn to run the configured FastAPI application.
