This file, `summarizer.py`, is intended to provide functionality for summarizing conversation messages using the Google Gemini API. It initializes the `google.generativeai` library with an API key from a configuration module. The main function, `summarize`, is designed to take a list of message strings and return a summary. However, the current implementation is a placeholder stub that simply reports the number of messages and provides a preview of the first few, with a TODO indicating future full Gemini integration.
