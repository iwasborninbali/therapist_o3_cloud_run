This file provides a client module for interacting with Google Cloud Firestore. Its main purpose is to manage user-specific data for a bot application, including conversation history, summaries, and custom system prompts. It includes functions like `get_history`, `add_message`, `get_summaries`, `add_summary`, `get_system_prompt`, and `set_system_prompt` to perform CRUD operations on this data. The Firestore client is initialized lazily, and database operations are wrapped with retry logic. This module serves as a data access layer for storing and retrieving user information in Firestore.
