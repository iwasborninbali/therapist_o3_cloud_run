This Python file (`openai_client.py`) provides an interface for interacting with the OpenAI Chat Completions API. It includes a lazy initialization of the OpenAI client using configuration settings and a retry mechanism for API calls. The main function, `get_response`, sends a list of messages to OpenAI and handles responses, including orchestrating tool execution if the model requests function calls and a `tools_manager` is provided. It executes the requested tools and makes a follow-up API call with the results to get the final response. The file returns the final AI-generated content or an error message.
