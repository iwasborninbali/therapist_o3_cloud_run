This file provides a Python wrapper for interacting with the OpenAI API, specifically for chat completions. It includes a function `get_client` for lazy initialization of the OpenAI client using an API key from a configuration object. The main function `get_response` sends a list of messages to the OpenAI chat completions endpoint (`client.chat.completions.create`), extracts the AI's response, and handles potential errors. It also utilizes a retry mechanism for API calls.
