This file provides a Python client for interacting with the OpenAI API. It initializes the `OpenAI` client using configuration settings, including the API key and model. The main function, `get_response`, sends a list of conversation messages to the API to generate a text response. It incorporates retry logic for transient errors and includes basic error handling and logging.
