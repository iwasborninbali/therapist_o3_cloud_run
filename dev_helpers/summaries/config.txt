This `config.py` file manages application configuration by loading settings from environment variables, including a `.env` file. It includes specific logic to handle Firebase credentials, prioritizing Cloud Run service identity or using environment variables for local development. A `Config` class structures various settings like API keys, Firebase details, and operational parameters. The `Config` class includes a `validate` method to ensure required environment variables are present. The file also defines a large default system prompt for an AI therapist role and constants for proactive messaging features.
