This Python file serves as the central configuration manager for an application. It loads environment variables from a `.env` file and the system, configures basic logging, and dynamically handles Firebase authentication credentials based on whether it's running on Google Cloud Run or locally. A `Config` class is defined to hold various settings like API keys for Telegram, OpenAI, and Gemini, Firebase details, and operational parameters, including a method to validate that required variables are set. The file also defines a large `DEFAULT_SYSTEM_PROMPT` and other constants used by the application.
