This `config.py` file manages application configuration by loading settings from environment variables using `dotenv`. It sets up basic logging and includes specific logic to handle Firebase credentials, prioritizing Cloud Run service identity or falling back to environment variables like `FIREBASE_CRED_JSON` or `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS`. A `Config` class encapsulates various settings for services like Telegram, OpenAI, and Gemini, providing a `validate` method to check for required variables. The file also defines constants and a detailed `DEFAULT_SYSTEM_PROMPT` string used for the application's AI persona.
