This file manages application configuration by loading settings from environment variables and potentially a `.env` file. It includes specific logic to handle Firebase service account JSON provided via an environment variable, writing it to a temporary file for use. A `Config` dataclass structures various settings such as API keys for Telegram, OpenAI, and Gemini, Firebase details, and operational parameters. The settings loaded include credentials, model names, retry parameters, and history/summarization thresholds. A `validate` method is provided to check for the presence of required configuration values.
