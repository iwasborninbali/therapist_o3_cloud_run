This `config.py` file manages application settings by loading environment variables from a `.env` file and configuring basic logging. It includes special handling for Firebase credentials, writing JSON content to a temporary file if the `FIREBASE_CRED_JSON` variable is set. A `Config` class encapsulates various settings for services like Telegram, OpenAI, and Gemini, along with application parameters, and provides a method to validate their presence. Finally, it defines a comprehensive `DEFAULT_SYSTEM_PROMPT` outlining the role and guidelines for an AI therapist.
