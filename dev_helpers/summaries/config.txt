This `config.py` file is responsible for loading application configuration from environment variables, including those in a `.env` file. It specifically handles Firebase credentials, detecting if running on Google Cloud Run or falling back to local methods like `FIREBASE_CRED_JSON` or `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS`. A `Config` class centralizes various settings such as API keys (Telegram, OpenAI, Gemini), Firebase project ID, retry parameters, and history thresholds, and includes a validation method. The file also defines a detailed `DEFAULT_SYSTEM_PROMPT` for an AI therapist role and constants for proactive messaging intervals.
