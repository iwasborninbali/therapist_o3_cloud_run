This `config.py` file manages application configuration by loading settings primarily from environment variables, including a `.env` file. It initializes basic logging and handles conditional setup for Firebase credentials, distinguishing between Cloud Run and local development environments. A `Config` class encapsulates various settings such as API keys, retry parameters, and history limits, and includes a method to validate that required variables are present. The file also defines a `DEFAULT_SYSTEM_PROMPT` constant used for the AI therapist role. It ensures essential configurations are loaded and validated before the application starts.
