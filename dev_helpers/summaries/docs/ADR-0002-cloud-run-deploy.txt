This ADR documents the decision to automate the deployment of the Telegram AI Assistant application. It proposes using a GitHub Actions workflow (`deploy.yml`) for a CI/CD pipeline. This pipeline will build the Docker image, push it to Google Artifact Registry, and deploy it to a Google Cloud Run service (`TELEGRAM-AI`). It leverages GitHub Secrets for secure credential management, passing necessary environment variables to Cloud Run. Finally, a script will update the Telegram bot's webhook URL after a successful deployment.
