This Architectural Decision Record (ADR-0007) documents the decision to replace a separate, always-on Cloud Run service previously used for proactive message scheduling. The prior approach incurred continuous costs and lacked precise timing. The new architecture leverages Cloud Scheduler to trigger a dedicated HTTP endpoint (`/admin/send-proactive`) on the main bot service. This change reduces costs, improves scheduling precision, simplifies the overall architecture, and enhances reliability. The decision is accepted, implemented, and deployed.
