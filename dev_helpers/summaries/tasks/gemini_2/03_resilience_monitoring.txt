This document outlines the task of implementing resilience and monitoring for a Telegram AI Assistant bot. It involved creating FastAPI middleware for structured error handling and adding retry mechanisms with exponential backoff for external API calls (Telegram, OpenAI) and Firestore operations. Retry parameters were made configurable. Finally, documentation for monitoring Cloud Run logs and recommended alerts was added. The task is marked as complete.
