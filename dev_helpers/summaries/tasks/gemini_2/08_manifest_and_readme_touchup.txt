This file describes Task 08, focused on updating project documentation following a transition to a single-service architecture utilizing Cloud Scheduler. The main purpose is to ensure the project manifest and README accurately reflect this change. Key actions included adding ADR-0007, which documents the Cloud Scheduler decision, marking the superseded ADR-0003 in the manifest, and removing outdated references from the README. This task finalizes the documentation for the new architecture, providing clear history and accurate metadata.
