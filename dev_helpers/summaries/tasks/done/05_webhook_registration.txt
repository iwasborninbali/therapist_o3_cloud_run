This document outlines the implementation of an automatic webhook registration utility for a Telegram bot. It involves creating a Python script (`scripts/set_webhook.py`) to call the Telegram `setWebhook` API using the bot token and service URL, incorporating retry logic for robustness. The main bot application (`bot/main.py`) is updated to include a root path handler for basic health checks. The `README.md` file is modified to document the script's usage and integration into the deployment process. This setup ensures the bot's webhook is correctly configured automatically after deployment.
