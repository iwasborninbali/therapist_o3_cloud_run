This document outlines Task 11: Fix Proactive Scheduling. The problem addressed is duplicate proactive messages caused by the scheduler script using hard-coded timezone loops. The solution involves implementing a universal scheduler that checks timezones per-user and uses Firestore for deduplication. Key steps include updating `firestore_client.py` with metadata functions and rewriting `scripts/proactive_messages.py` to incorporate the new logic and remove the old loops.
