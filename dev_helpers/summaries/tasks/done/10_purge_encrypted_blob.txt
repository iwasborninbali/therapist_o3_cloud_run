This document outlines Task 10: Purge Encrypted Blob Artifacts. Its main purpose is to remove encrypted binary credential files (`firebase_creds_encrypted.bin`) and associated code. This is required to comply with a new YAML-based environment variable strategy. Key steps include deleting the file, updating ignore lists, removing encryption logic from `config.py`, and updating scripts, documentation, and CI/tests. The task aims to eliminate the use of encrypted blobs for credentials.
