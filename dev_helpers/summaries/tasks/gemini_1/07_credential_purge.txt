This document describes a task to address a critical security vulnerability: a Firebase service account key was leaked into the repository. The main purpose is to remove the leaked key, prevent future occurrences, and update project documentation and CI/CD pipelines. This involves deleting the credential file and associated Firebase Functions code/configuration, updating `.gitignore` rules, and amending ADRs and READMEs with stricter security guidance. Key steps include adding CI checks to fail builds if credential files or Firebase Functions artifacts are detected. It emphasizes that the leaked key must also be immediately revoked/rotated in the Google Cloud Console.
