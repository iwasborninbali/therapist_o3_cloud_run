This document outlines a task to deploy a hotfix for the `therapist-scheduler` service. The purpose is to restore proactive messaging functionality. The plan involves creating a script (`build_and_deploy_scheduler.sh`) to build a Docker image, copy environment variables from another service, and deploy with specific settings (service account, min-instances=1). Documentation (`README.md`) and project configuration (`project_manifest.json`) are also updated. The goal is to successfully deploy and run the correctly configured service.
