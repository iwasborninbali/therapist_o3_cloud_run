This document outlines a security task to remove baked Firebase service account credentials from Docker images. The primary goal is to transition from embedding the `firebase-service-account-key.json` file in the image to providing credentials solely via the `FIREBASE_CRED_JSON` environment variable at runtime. This involves modifying Dockerfiles, `.gitignore`, `.dockerignore`, `config.py`, deployment scripts, and adding CI checks to prevent credential leaks. The task aims to enhance security by ensuring secrets are not part of the build artifact. Acceptance criteria include credential-free images, env-only provision, and CI failure upon detecting credentials in the build context.
