This document outlines a task to fix security vulnerabilities related to Firebase credential handling. It addresses a leaked credential file and insecure configuration fallbacks in files like `config.py`. The core actions involve deleting the leaked file, removing hardcoded paths, and ensuring the `FIREBASE_CRED_JSON` environment variable is consistently used. The task also requires updating `.gitignore`, CI workflows (`deploy.yml`), documentation, and tests (`conftest.py`). The ultimate goal is to eliminate credential files from the repo, use secure environment variables, and ensure robust CI guards.
