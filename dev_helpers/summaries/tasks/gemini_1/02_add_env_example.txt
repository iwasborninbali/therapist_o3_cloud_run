This markdown file describes a development task focused on environment configuration. The main purpose is to create an `.env.example` file containing required environment variables. It also involves updating `.gitignore` to exclude the actual `.env` file while keeping the example, and updating `README.md` with instructions. This task ensures new developers can easily set up their local environment by copying the example file.
