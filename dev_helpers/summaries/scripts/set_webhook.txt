This Python script is designed to configure the webhook for a Telegram bot. It takes the bot token and the service URL (where the bot is hosted) as input, either via command-line arguments or environment variables. The script makes an API call to Telegram's `setWebhook` endpoint using the `requests` library. It includes retry logic for failed requests and logs the process outcome. The `set_telegram_webhook` function handles the API interaction, while `main` parses arguments and orchestrates the call.
