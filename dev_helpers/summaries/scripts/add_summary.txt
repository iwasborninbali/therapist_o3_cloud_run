This Python script uploads a summary from a specified text file to Firebase Firestore. It takes the filename as a command-line argument, which must follow the format `summary_<user_id>.txt`. The script extracts the user ID from the filename and reads the summary content from the file. It then calls an imported function (`add_summary`) to save this data to Firebase. The script includes checks for file existence, filename format, and successful data addition.
