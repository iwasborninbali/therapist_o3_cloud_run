This shell script automates the process of building a Docker image and deploying it to Google Cloud Run. It configures Google Cloud Platform (GCP) project, region, and service details, then checks for necessary tools like the `gcloud` CLI. The script builds the Docker image locally, pushes it to Google Artifact Registry, and deploys this image to the specified Cloud Run service. A notable aspect is that it deploys only the image, explicitly preserving any existing environment variables on the Cloud Run service from previous deployments. Upon success, it outputs the service URL.
