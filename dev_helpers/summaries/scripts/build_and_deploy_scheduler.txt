This bash script automates the build and deployment of the `therapist-scheduler` service to Google Cloud Run. It builds a Docker image using `Dockerfile.scheduler` and pushes it to Google Artifact Registry. The script then fetches environment variables from the existing `therapist-o3` Cloud Run service. Finally, it deploys the `therapist-scheduler` service to Cloud Run using the built image, the fetched environment variables, and specific configuration like service account and minimum instances.
