This README describes a containerized Telegram bot that serves as an AI assistant. It integrates with OpenAI for generating responses and uses Firebase Firestore to manage conversation history. Key features include context-aware responses, automatic conversation summarization using Gemini, and user-specific prompts. The bot manages conversation length by trimming old messages and storing summaries to maintain context. It is designed for deployment on Google Cloud Run with automated CI/CD via GitHub Actions.
