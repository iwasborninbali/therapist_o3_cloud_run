# Task 08: Manifest and README Touchup

**Status**: done  
**Assignee**: gemini_1 (completed for gemini_2)  
**Created**: 2025-05-26  

## Objective
Update project metadata to reflect the completed transition from dual-service to single-service + Cloud Scheduler architecture.

## Context
Following the successful cleanup of the separate scheduler service, project documentation needs final updates to:
- Add ADR-0007 to project manifest
- Mark ADR-0003 as superseded
- Ensure README.md has no lingering references to therapist-scheduler

## Files Updated

### 1. project_manifest.json ✅
- ✅ Added ADR-0007 entry with path docs/ADR-0007-cloud-scheduler-supersedes-separate-service.md
- ✅ Added "status": "superseded" to ADR-0003 entry

### 2. docs/ADR-0007-cloud-scheduler-supersedes-separate-service.md ✅
- ✅ Created comprehensive ADR documenting architecture decision
- ✅ Included context, decision rationale, consequences
- ✅ Documented implementation status and monitoring approach
- ✅ Referenced related tasks and superseded ADR-0003

### 3. docs/ADR-0003-scheduler-as-separate-service.md ✅
- ✅ Already marked as "Superseded by ADR-0007" (done previously)

### 4. README.md ✅
- ✅ Verified no lingering references to therapist-scheduler service
- ✅ Contains correct gcloud commands for 4 Cloud Scheduler jobs
- ✅ Architecture diagram reflects single-service + Cloud Scheduler
