# Task: Resilience and Monitoring

## Objective
Implement robust error handling, retry mechanisms, and monitoring capabilities to ensure reliable operation of the Telegram AI Assistant.

## Files to Modify/Create
- `bot/error_middleware.py` (new) - FastAPI middleware for exception handling
- `bot/retry_utils.py` (new) - Utility functions for retry mechanisms
- `bot/main.py` - Add error middleware integration
- `bot/telegram_router.py` - Add retry mechanisms for API calls
- `bot/firestore_client.py` - Add retry decorators for Firestore operations
- `bot/openai_client.py` - Add retry decorator for OpenAI API calls
- `config.py` - Add retry configuration parameters
- `README.md` - Add monitoring documentation

## Implementation Details

### Error Middleware
- Created a FastAPI middleware to catch unhandled exceptions
- Implemented structured JSON logging for better Cloud Run integration
- Added standardized error responses that maintain Telegram API compatibility

### Retry Mechanisms
- Implemented exponential backoff retry for Telegram API calls (1s, 2s, 4s)
- Added retry capabilities for Firestore operations
- Added retry for OpenAI API calls
- Created utility decorators for both synchronous and asynchronous functions

### Configuration
- Added `RETRY_ATTEMPTS=3` and `RETRY_BASE_DELAY=1.0` to config
- Made retry parameters configurable via environment variables

### Monitoring Documentation
- Added guidance for Cloud Run logs monitoring
- Added recommended alerts for error severity and 5xx rate
- Documented resilience features in README

## Status: done
